# Uber Trip Analysis Dashboard

An **interactive Power BI dashboard** analyzing over **100,000 Uber rides** to provide insights into bookings, revenue, average fares, trip duration, and routes. This project demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to support **data-driven decision-making** in the ride-sharing business.

## Business Problem

Uber stakeholders need to understand **ride patterns, customer behavior, and operational metrics** to optimize fleet allocation, pricing, and marketing strategies. Raw trip data is complex, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze manually.

## Goal

The goal was to build a **user-friendly, interactive dashboard** that highlights key metrics, uncovers trends, and provides actionable insights for business decisions.

## Charts & Visualizations

- **Time-Series Charts:** Track rides, revenue, and fares over time to identify peak hours.  
- **Heatmaps:** Visualize trip density and popular routes across cities.  
- **Pie Charts:** Show distribution of vehicle types, payment methods, and trip types.  
- **Tables & Cards:** Display KPIs like total bookings, total revenue, average fare, and trip duration.  

These charts were chosen to make trends **visually intuitive**, support quick comparisons, and allow deep dives into segmented data.

## Insights & Business Impact

- Identified **peak booking hours** to optimize driver allocation.  
- Highlighted **popular routes and cities** for targeted marketing.  
- Uncovered **payment method and vehicle preferences** to enhance customer experience.  
- Provided **revenue and operational insights** to support strategic decision-making.

## Tools Used
